## 0.4.1 (unreleased): clean, flat-faced peaks

After Sammi's first look in-game (12 Nov 2026): the row of separate peaks seen from a distance was
right, but close up the summits were torn into shards, holes and blade-thin walls. He asked for
the even, angular slopes of the old mod on the new separate peaks, each peak straight-sided with a
sharp top.

- Clean faces: where a peak stands clear of the land, the ground is cut exactly at the peak's own
  height, block by block, with no 3-D roughness, and is solid for 12 blocks down. On a test peak
  99.1% of columns sit exactly at the intended height.
- Factor is vanilla's again. Raising it to 16 had let caves come within 3 blocks of the surface,
  which is where the cave mouths in the faces came from.
- Flat faces: between two ridges the face is now mostly flat, like the side of a pyramid, where
  it was a scooped hollow (`facet` 0.75).
- Sturdier: nearly straight sides, 54 degrees at the summit easing to 42 (was 62 to 39), and
  ridge lines wander less.
- Debug commands `dfmap` and `biomemap` write maps of a density function or of the biomes.

## 0.4.0 (unreleased): restart

- Started again from scratch (Sammi, 11 Nov 2026). The custom mountain generator, the continents,
  the mountain biomes, the world type, the debug commands and their tests are all removed; the
  world is vanilla again.
- New approach: work through vanilla's own `offset`, `factor` and `jaggedness` density functions.
  Two attempts at adjusting them (ridge lines, filled rings, wider spikes) moved the ground only
  about 4 blocks on a 250-block range, so they were dropped.
- Horn peaks, after Sammi's WorldPainter references: in low-erosion country away from the coast
  a field of separate pyramid peaks is added to the land
  (`atlasmountains:horns`): steep summits, flaring skirts, 3 to 5 ridges per peak, varied heights.
  River valleys are kept.
- The upper part of each peak takes vanilla's peak biome for its climate, so summits are rock,
  snow or ice, not forest.
- Vanilla's land is left at its own height under the peaks (a first build pressed it down to
  y 110). To make room the overworld is taller: build height y 320 to y 512, terrain ceiling
  y 256 to y 472-488.
- Debug commands: `mountains`, `heightmap`, `df`. Shape prototype and viewer under `tools/`.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-10)

Minecraft 26.3.

- Ported to Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.20.1, Fabric API 0.165.2 and Java 25.
- Mountains now fill vanilla's own mountain footprint: a network of ridges meeting at junctions,
  with small enclosed valleys where ridges part.
- Smaller, rougher mountain provinces; biomes elsewhere at twice vanilla size.
- Mountains about 20% lower (design summit y 232), with summit heights varying between massifs.
- Snow starts at a climate-dependent snow line instead of a hard biome edge.
- Province edges blend into vanilla terrain by height, so there are no walls, flooded rings or
  sunken plates at the edge.
- Faster region generation.
- Removed the older layout experiments (they are on the `archive/layout-experiments` branch).

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-08)

Minecraft 1.21.1.

- Continents from a large fractal noise: big organic landmasses and islands, spawn on land.
- Branching mountain chains placed inside mountain provinces, with foothills, dominant summits and
  taller peaks at junctions.
- Treeless biomes above the treeline; vanilla's own peaks removed.

## 0.1.0

Minecraft 1.21.1. First prototype: parallel horn-peak ranges over the whole world.
